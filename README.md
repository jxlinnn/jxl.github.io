# Excel Project Profolio
## Welcome to my portfolio for demonstrating my learning and growth in Excel skills. The screenshots below display the final result of my projects through which I use data analysis and data visualizations for generating insights. If you would like to explore further, I have linked the excel workbook available to download.

## [Superstore Sales Tracker](https://github.com/jxlinnn/jxlinnn.github.io/blob/main/excel_projects/superstore_sales.xlsx)
The sales tracker displays the total sales for each item and the number of orders from 2015-2018. In additon, there is a slicer and timeline that allows the user to subset the data based on the desired region and/or time period. There is also a table that provides orders information sorted from the most recent to the oldest with a scrolling bar.

## [U.S Cost of Living Dashboard](https://github.com/jxlinnn/jxlinnn.github.io/blob/main/excel_projects/cost_of_living_us.xlsx)
The dashboard helps visualize cost of living conditions in each U.S state. Median household income of each state is sorted in descending order. The color formatting is based on each state's average household expenditure which is visaluzed by the colorbar. In addition, the average household expenditure is broken down based on each category and can be visualized by stacked bar chart.
